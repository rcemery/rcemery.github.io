                  <h2>How to get started.</h2>
                  <p>All food carts (called mobile food units) must be licensed and pass a health inspection prior to construction or operation. This applies to any portable vehicle where food is prepared, sold and/or dispensed to a consumer.</p>
                  <h3>Get a license.</h3>
                    <p><strong>If you are opening, remodeling or reinstating a mobile food unit:</strong></br>
  You must first obtain a plan review.
  Submit to Multnomah County Environmental Health:</br>

  <ul><li>A completed  <a href="https://multco.us/file/8899/download">Plan Review Packet (113.52 KB)</a>
  <li>Detailed plans of the unit
  <li>The plan review fee payment</ul>
  You must also obtain and pass any other required inspections from local authorities.</br></br>

  Expect to receive a response within 10 business days. After your plan has been approved,
  you may begin construction. You may then submit your mobile unit <a href="https://multco.us/file/10571/download">License Application (51.21 KB)</a> and fee.</br></br>

  Once construction is complete, call us to arrange a pre-opening inspection.
  This can usually be scheduled 1 week after you call.
  You must receive and pass the Health Department pre-opening inspection before you can open.</br></br>

  After a food service license has been acquired, the restaurant will receive its first inspection within a few weeks.
